# Description

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism (also called underactive thyroid, low thyroid or hypothyreosis) is a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Thyroid is responsible for providing energy to nearly every organ in the body.

It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, slow heart rate, depression, and weight gain.Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goiter.Untreated cases of hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.

Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery.The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.

Hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men.People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected.
